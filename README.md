Backtests are performed in 10â€“15 pairs, but I share only Bitcoin results.
This is just an example of backtest, you can change the timeframe of data and pairs.
An example of data is given as 'BTCUSDT15MINUTE2020-2023.csv'.

Returns are calculated as a cumulative sum.
Column names in return excels give the period and multiplier of the supertrend.
Trading fee and entry gap are not calculated because of that 3 and 5 minute timeframes look better in my results.
